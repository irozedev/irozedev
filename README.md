- 👋 Hi, I’m Stepan Roze (@irozedev) 
- 👀 I’m a passionate front-end developer with a knack for clean and efficient code. I love exploring the world of full-stack development, particularly with **JavaScript**, **Node.js**, and **MongoDB**.
- 🌱 Currently learning **Dutch** (A2 level), and I believe coding is a universal language that helps connect ideas and cultures. I’m always up for new challenges and love expanding my skill set.
- 💼 My background includes 4 years of front-end experience, focusing on **HTML/CSS**, **JavaScript**, and UI implementation. I also have 1 year of experience with **Node.js**, working on pet projects.
- 💞️ Looking to collaborate on **front-end** or **full-stack** projects, and open to learning from diverse teams and contributing to exciting ideas.
- 🎯 My goals: To improve my skills in building scalable, efficient applications while integrating my growing language proficiency.
- 📫 How to reach me: Feel free to reach out to me via GitHub.
- 🌍 Fun fact: Though I'm based in Belgium now, I'm originally from Kharkiv, Ukraine. I'm driven by a curiosity for cultures, languages, and, of course, code.
